## About Me

I am an Applied Scientist II at Amazon.com, working on scalable optimization systems for real-time labor planning. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan, where I was advised by Prof. Siqian Shen. My research focuses on mixed-integer and stochastic optimization, reinforcement learning, and machine learning-integrated optimization.

I am passionate about developing practical optimization solutions that combine mathematical rigor with real-world applications. My work spans quantum optimal control, traffic signal optimization, and large-scale resource planning problems. I also have ongoing research interests in GenAI agents and reinforcement learning.
